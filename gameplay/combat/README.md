# Combat

## Purpose

Damage pipeline, hit and hurt boxes, knockback, status effects, and applying element reactions.

**Closed until M4.** Built in M1, opens for PRs in M4 (see "Gameplay sub-areas" in docs/PLAN.md and "Opens for PRs" in docs/ROADMAP.md). Until then Claude maintains it; an outside PR is a gamble.

Element reactions are content data, so contributors add them without touching this code. Projectiles themselves come from `core/projectiles`; this area decides what a hit does.

## Contract

- **Public entry script:** `gameplay/combat/combat.gd`. Other code uses only this script and the events it sends and listens to; nothing else in the folder is public. The script arrives when the area is built.
- **Dependency direction:** `core` ← `gameplay` ← `content`. This area may use `core/` and the registry. `core/` never depends on it, and content never reaches into it.
- **Events** (`core/events/events.gd` owns the definitions; this list matches it and the table in [gameplay/README.md](../README.md)):
  - Sends: `enemy_died`, `damage_dealt`, `status_applied`.
  - Listens to: `projectile_hit` (from `core/projectiles`) and `spell_cast`.
- Areas never call each other directly; they talk through events. [gameplay/README.md](../README.md) has the rules every sub-area shares.

## Allowed files

`.gd` and `.tres`, plus `.uid`, `.import` and `.license` files. Limit: 1 MB per file. Typed GDScript only; no banned APIs. The text shared by all sub-areas is in [gameplay/README.md](../README.md).

## Steps

Not open yet. When it opens, follow the steps and test layout in [gameplay/README.md](../README.md).

## Example to copy

Arrives with Claude's first code for this area. Do not guess its layout before then.

## Validate

```sh

## Rating questions

A good PR here changes one step of the damage pipeline (a status effect, knockback, a hit or hurt box rule), reads reactions from data, and does not allocate per hit. Besides the standard criteria:

- Is damage applied the same for any player index and any enemy? Does it stay within the frame budget with 1,000+ projectiles?
- Does it keep to the dependency direction, without calling another area directly?
